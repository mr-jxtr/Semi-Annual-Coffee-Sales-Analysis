### Business Task:



- Identify the coffee type with the highest sales and strategies to boost overall sales.

- Determine the top-performing employee in terms of sales.

- Assess sales volume to optimize inventory and prevent shortages.


### Process:



- I gathered and extracted data from an Excel workbook.

- I used Python Jupyter Notebooks to process the data to ensure it was complete, valid, and reliable. (cleaning, manipulating, and wrangling)

- Created Sales KPI.

- I created a line chart showing the weekly sales trend.

- I created a sales-by-employee bar chart to see top employee performers.

- I created a sales-by-coffee bar chart to see which coffee has the most sales.

- I created filters to filter specific data in the line charts and the bar charts when clicked
